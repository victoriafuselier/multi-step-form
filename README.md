 Treehouse Code Adventures: Multi-Step Form

This was my first code adventure on Treehouse! It was a great learning tool and I plan to complete many more!

Code Adventure Description:
The form aims to collect specific details about a user in three stages. The user will be asked to enter their name, phone number, and email address before being able to submit the form. The design is user-friendly, with intuitive navigation buttons and a progress bar.

Extra Challenge: Add friendly custom validation messages to the form inputs.

I completed the project and the extra challenge. Feedback pending!
